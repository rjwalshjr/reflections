What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git sets up the infrastructure required to start tracking versions.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a listing of files that 1) have been changed and
2) will be uploaded to Git repository. The working directory is the 'home'
directory of the clone.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

You can 'git add' files into the staging area into logical groups. To confirm,
you can use 'git diff' to understand which changes you've staged.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
history organized? How would branches help?

Branches are a way to isolate development efforts and incorporate them into
the larger effort in an asynchronous way.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Branches help to explain dependencies, history, and more clearly see isolated
work.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

Merging two branches together combines the additions from both branches into a
single file. It is a union of two lines of work.
